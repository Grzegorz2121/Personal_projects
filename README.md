# Personal_projects

This repositor shows my personal projects.
Those projects aren't finished. Their syntax might be different in different parts of the program,
programs might crash due to unchecked conditions, and their implementation might be confusing, inefficient.

Their only purpose it to show my ability to understand C# launguage.
Code wasn't meant to be seen by other people than the author, thats why autor haven't made any usefull comments or documentation.
Those projects didnt have any plan. They were planed as they were coded. Mainly to learn and practice.
They are not certanly good enough for publishing. They are only A PROOF OF CONCEPT - A PROTOTYPE.

If anybody want to know how those programs actualy work, author is happy to show and explain it personaly, throught
video conference throught internet or in person.

At they day of publishing this repository, all apps could have been compiled and run.

DataLab is a WPF app. It is a graphical script interpreter where user can use "blocks" to create various data processing algorithms.
Blocks are divided into 3(4) sections: Input, Output and Processing (+Flow) blocks. Those allow to collect, process and output the data.
The main goal was to create a easy scripting launguage that is fast and "errorless"

PaJsonEditor is a windows forms application. It was made in order to edit and manage .json files containing json data structures.
The app allows players of Planetary Anihilation community to edit unit parameters easly. In addition to that editor will be able to do various usefull funtions like: deconstructing unit models in order to retieve data about turret placement, comparing units, providing masks showing only the most important unit characteristics to a modder.

Sensor_data_converter is a small app for converting 3d points from the array of heights to the list of points.
It was created on win7 and only works on win7. win10 has some strange issues with parsing.

Big_file_reader is an another small app used to check if the output from the Sensor_data_converter was correctly processed.

BIGG_DATA is a app to create artificial matrixes (.csv format) used as testing data for the Sensor_data_converter
